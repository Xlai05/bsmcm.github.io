## BEFORE RUNNING, HERE ARE SET UPS!
 
This project is run with local database (MySQL) and this README contains prerequisites for this program to work.


Use XAMPP to start the db locally or whatever works for you :)


- Here are commands to run in the terminal:
```
npm install express
npm install mysql2
npm install cors
npm install -g nodemon
npm install dotenv
npm install body-parser
```


- When STARTING the server, execute this:
```node server.js```

- When STOPPING the server, execute this:
```npx kill-port 3000```


### Should you want a sample of the DB, do not worry as its on the repo. Syl out :)
